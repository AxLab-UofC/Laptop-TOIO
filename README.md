# Requirements
Before you use Laptop-Toio, you will need to download:
- [Processing](https://processing.org/download)
    - Also make sure to add the `oscP5` library from the `Sketch > Import Library... > Manage Libraries...` button.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

# Structure
![Frame 1](https://github.com/AxLab-UofC/Laptop-TOIO/assets/66401951/841f6990-a5f2-4c6b-8e87-c6a39817b4cd)

All of the Low-Level Bluetooth Toio is handled within Rust, while the Higher-Level Simulations is done within Processing.

# Connecting with Rust
Our Rust code allows us to connect to toios by using their 'name' (An internal 3-digit alphanumeric id built into the firmware), or their AxLab ID (Written on the bottom of the toio). We can connect using the following command

First, clone this repository, and use terminal to navigate to rust_osc folder. From there, run: 

```
cargo run -- -a 48,46
```

NOTE: Do not uses spaces between the IDs.

Using the `-a` flag allows us to connect using the AxLab ID. When needed, we can also use `-n` to connect directly to their internal name, or even combine the two. For example: `cargo run -- -n P1B` or `cargo run -- -a 46 -n P1B`

## Special Flags
There are special flags for specific cases.

- Running Laptop-Toio with the command `cargo run -- -s` will allow you to connect to all nearby toios, in case you don't want to deal with the hassle of looking over which toios you have. NOTE: Only use this flag when there is no one else using toios nearby.
- Running Laptop-Toio with the command `cargo run -- -o -a 48,46` will attempt to connect to the toios in the specific order you passed them in. In this case, that would be 48 and then 46

### Connecting to Unregistered Toios
See the following: README_unregistered.md. NOTE: Not intended for students taking classes taught by Professor Ken Nakagaki.

# Running the Simulation with Processing
The full [toio API](https://toio.github.io/toio-spec/en/docs/about) allows us to send commands and request information from the toio. Most of these API requests have been implemented within Laptop-toio on the Rust and Processing side to allow us to control toios. All of these functions are available on the `Cube` tab of the processing code. All of the toios are stored an array called `cubes`. This means that you can access each toio with `cubes[i]`, where `i` is the order thetoios connected in.

## Processing Code Structure
There are 5 tabs in the Laptop-Toio Processing Code:
- The `toio processing` tab includes three core functions: 
    - `settings`: The function allows you to configure your program
    - `setup`: This function is called once at the beginning of your program
    - `draw`: This function is called continously every tick
This tab is analogous to the `setup` and `loop` structure in arduino
- The `cube` tab includes all of the information on the `Cube` struct which stores most of the values and methods used to communicate with toios
- The `events` tab allows you to handle different events from the keyboard, mouse or the toios.
- The `motorVelocityTarget` tab includes the code for the `velocityTarget` function, which is an advanced function used to travel smoothly over time
- The `osc` tab handles the communication with the rust code, and sends commands to the toios.

For the most part, you will purely be writing your code in the `toio processing` and `events` tabs, and `cube` can be refered for you to quickly understand different commands.

## Writing toio Processing code
Processing allows you to write code in two ways:
- The `draw()` function is called continously on a loop. If you want your code to run on a regular interval, this is the best place to put it.
- The `events` tab is comprised of many functions that are called on certain events. 
    - Keyboard and Mouse events call the `keyPressed`, `mousePressed` and `mouseReleased` functions. If you want an extended look at the GUI events that are registered by Processing, you can look at the Keyboard and Mouse sections [here](https://processing.org/reference/#input).
    - toio events automatically call the `buttonDown`, `buttonUp`, `collision` and `doubleTap` functions. These functions will pass the toio IDs as a function parameter, allowing you to use them in your code.

## Writing toio Processing commands

### OUTPUT Commands
We are send comannds to control to control:
- [The Motors](https://toio.github.io/toio-spec/en/docs/ble_motor): NOTE: the maximum speed of a motor on a toio is 115. That commands that can control the toio are:
    -  `cubes[i].motor`: can be called with either `leftSpeed, rightSpeed` or `leftSpeed, rightSpeed, duration`, allowing you to control the speed of each motor individually for a set duration. Further documentation can be found [here](https://toio.github.io/toio-spec/en/docs/ble_motor#motor-control) and [here](https://toio.github.io/toio-spec/en/docs/ble_motor/#motor-control-with-specified-duration).
    - `cubes[i].target`: can be called with `x, y, theta`, `mode, x, y, theta` or `control, timeout, mode, maxspeed, speedchange, x, y, theta`, allowing you to target a specific location. Further documentation can be found [here](https://toio.github.io/toio-spec/en/docs/ble_motor#motor-control-with-target-specified).
    - `cubes[i].accelerate`: can be called with `speed, acc, rotateVelocity, rotateDir, dir, priority, duration`, allowing you to control acceleration of the motors. Further documentation can be found [here](https://toio.github.io/toio-spec/en/docs/ble_motor#motor-control-with-acceleration-specified).
    - `cubes[i].multiTarget`: can be called with `mode, targets` or `control, timeout, mode, maxspeed, speedchange, targets` where targets are a 2D array for each target marked as `{x, y}` or `{x, y, theta}`. Unless specified, `theta = 0`. Further documentation can be found [here](https://toio.github.io/toio-spec/en/docs/ble_motor/#motor-control-with-multiple-targets-specified).
    - **Advanced:** `cubes[i].velocityTarget` is a function developed by AxLab to allow toiois to follow a continously moving target. When `velocityTarget` is called with `x, y` values every loop, the motion between the targets will be automatically smoothed out. WARNING: This behavior will only occur if the function is called *every* loop. The velocity is caculated by storing values within the `targetx, targety` and `targetTime` variables within the `Cube` class.
- [The LED Indicator](https://toio.github.io/toio-spec/en/docs/ble_light):
    - `cubes[i].led` can be used to set the LED to a certain color with `duration, red, green, blue` or to produce an LED sequence with `repetitions, lights` where `lights` are a 2D array with each light in the sequence arranged as `{duration, red, green, blue}`. Further documentation can be found [here](https://toio.github.io/toio-spec/en/docs/ble_light).
- [The Speaker](https://toio.github.io/toio-spec/en/docs/ble_sound):
    - `cubes[i].sound` can be called with `soundeffect, volume` to play sound effects. Further documentation can be found [here](https://toio.github.io/toio-spec/en/docs/ble_sound).
    - `cubes[i].midi` can be used to play a certain note with `duration, noteID, volume` or to produce an note sequence with `repetitions, notes` where `note` are a 2D array with each note in the sequence arranged as `{duration, noteID, volume}` or `{duration, noteID}`. Unless specified, `volume = 255`. Further documentation can be found [here](https://toio.github.io/toio-spec/en/docs/ble_sound/#playing-the-midi-note-numbers).


### INPUT Parameters and Commands

We automatically recieve updates about:
- [Position](https://toio.github.io/toio-spec/en/docs/ble_id): The values of `cubes[i].x`, `cubes[i].y`, and `cubes[i].theta` will automatically update to the location and angle of each toio.
- [Battery](https://toio.github.io/toio-spec/en/docs/ble_battery): The value of `cubes[i].battery` will automatically update to the battery level of each toio.
- [Button](https://toio.github.io/toio-spec/en/docs/ble_button): The value of `cubes[i].buttonDown` will automatically change on button press of each toio. Changes in this state will also trigger the `buttonDown` and `buttonUp` functions.
